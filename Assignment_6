Q1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?
    the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: 
    "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline, and "\r" is a carriage return. Conversely, prefixing a special character with "\" turns it into an ordinary character.
    
Q2. What do the escape characters n and t stand for?
    "\n" is a carriage return is used to represent a newline.
    "\t" is a tab, it is used to represent ceratin whitespace characters.
    
Q3. What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?
    We have to use two backslash for a string is used.
    
Q4. The string "Howl's Moving Castle" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem?
    The single quote in Howl's is correct because we have mentioned the above string inside a double quoted string.So, single quote inside that string is not considered.
    
Q5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?
    Just use \n ; Python automatically translates that to the proper newline character for your platform.
