Q1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?
    The regular expression functions identies the accurate patterns of characters and are useful for data validation, 
 for example, type checks, range checks, and checks for characters that are not allowed. re.compile() function is used to return Regex objects.
 
 
Q2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?
    Raw strings are used so that backslashes do not have to be escaped.
 
 
Q3. What is the return value of the search() method?
    Tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
    
    
Q4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?
    The group() method is used to return strings of the matched items.


Q5. In the regex which created from the r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?
    Group 0 covers the entire match,
    Group 1 covers the first set of parantheses,
    Group 2 covers the second set of parantheses.
    

Q6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?
    Periods and parantheses can be escaped with a backslash: (\),(, and \).
    

Q7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?
    If the regex has no group, a list of strings is returned.
    If the regex has group, a list of tuples of strings is returned.
    

Q8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?
    The | character is used to signify that either, or between two groups.
    

Q9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?
    Each character in a regular expression is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, 
or a regular character that has a string literal meaning.
Eg: in the regex b. , 'b' is a literal character that matches just 'b' while'.


Q10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?
    A star is very similar to a plus, the only difference is that while the plus matches 1 or more of the preceding character/group, the star matches 0 or more.
    

Q11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?
    The {4} matches exactly four instances of the preceding group. The {4,5} matches four and five instances only.


Q12. What do you mean by the \d, \w, and \s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?
    The \d,\w and \s shorthand character classes match a single digit, word or space character, respectively.

Q13. What do means by \D, \W, and \S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?
    The \D ,\W and \S shorthand character slasses match a single character that is not a digit,word, or space character, respectively.
    

Q14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?
    The performs a greedy match, and the .? performs a nonr=greedy match.
    

Q15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?
    The syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class is [0-9a-z] or [a-z0-9]
    

Q16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?
    IGNORECASE in the match() function or the sub() function to search for a case insensitive string in the text.


Q17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?
    The . character normally matches any character except the newline character. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile, then the dot will also match newline characters.


Q18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?

    '11 drummers,10 pipers, five rings, 4 hens'


Q19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?
    
    The re.VERBOSE argument allows you to add whitespace and comments to the string passed to re.compile().
    

Q20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:
    '42'
    '1,234'
    '6,368,745'
    but not the following:
    '12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)
    '1234' (which lacks commas)
    
    re.compile(r'^\d{1,3}(,\d{3}*$') will create this regex , but other regex strings can produce a similar regular expression.

Q21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:
    'Haruto Watanabe'
    'Alice Watanabe'
    'RoboCop Watanabe'
    but not the following:
    'haruto Watanabe' (where the first name is not capitalized)
    'Mr. Watanabe' (where the preceding word has a nonletter character)
    'Watanabe' (which has no first name)
    'Haruto watanabe' (where Watanabe is not capitalized)
   
   recomile(r'[A-Z][a-z]*\sWatanable')
    

Q22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:
    'Alice eats apples.'
    'Bob pets cats.'
    'Carol throws baseballs.'
    'Alice throws Apples.'
    'BOB EATS CATS.'
    but not the following:
    'RoboCop eats apples.'
    'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'
    'Carol eats 7 cats.'
      re.compie(r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\s(eats|pets|throws)\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\.',
      re.IGNORECASE)
