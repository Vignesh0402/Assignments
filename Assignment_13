Q1.what advantages do excel spreadsheets have over csv spreadsheets?
ANS:
    The difference is that in CSV or comma-separated values, the data is in text format separated by commas. 
While in Excel or xls., information is in tabular form in rows and columns. Moreover, the CSV file extension 
has no formatting in data. Whereas in Excel, we can format the data as per our requirement.

Q2.what do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?
ANS:
      import csv
      outputFile = open('output.csv', 'w', newline='')
      outputWriter = csv.writer(outputFile)
      outputWriter.writerow(['spam', 'eggs', 'bacon', 'ham'])
         21
      outputWriter.writerow(['Hello, world!', 'eggs', 'bacon', 'ham'])
         32
      outputWriter.writerow([1, 2, 3.141592, 4])
         16
      outputFile.close()

    First, call open() and pass it 'w' to open a file in write mode.This will create the object you can 
then pass to csv.writer()  to create a Writer object.
    On Windows, you’ll also need to pass a blank string for the open() function’s newline keyword argument.
    
Q3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?
ANS:
    'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. On Windows, 'b' appended to the mode opens the file in binary mode, 
so there are also modes like 'rb', 'wb', and 'r+b'

Q4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?
ANS:
    The most common method to write data from a list to CSV file is the writerow() method of writer and DictWriter class. 
Example 1: Creating a CSV file and writing data row-wise into it using writer class. 

      import csv

      # data to be written row-wise in csv file
      data = [['Geeks'], [4], ['geeks !']]

      # opening the csv file in 'w+' mode
      file = open('g4g.csv', 'w+', newline ='')

      # writing the data into the file
      with file:   
          write = csv.writer(file)
          write.writerows(data)
          
Q5. What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?
ANS:
    The delimiter is the character that appears between cells on a row. By default, the delimiter for a CSV file is a comma. 
The line terminator is the character that comes at the end of a row. By default, the line terminator is a newline.

Q6.What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?
ANS:
    If you have a Python object, you can convert it into a JSON string by using the json.dumps() method.


          import json
          # a Python object (dict):
          x = {
            "name": "John",
            "age": 30,
            "city": "New York"
          }

          # convert into JSON:
          y = json.dumps(x)

          # the result is a JSON string:
          print(y)

Q7. What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?
ANS:
    Converting JSON data into a custom python object is also known as decoding or deserializing JSON data. 
To decode JSON data we can make use of the json. loads(), json. load() method and the object_hook parameter.
